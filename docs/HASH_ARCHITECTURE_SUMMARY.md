# Hash Architecture: Complete Summary & Roadmap

## What We Debated & Decided

This document summarizes all discussions about hash structures, state roots, and block commitments in HyperLicked.

---

## Part 1: The Core Questions

### Q1: Should BlockHash include AppHash?
**Answer: NO** ‚ùå

**Decided:** Separate consensus hash from application state hash (Tendermint/HotStuff model)

**Reason:**
- Blocks are proposed BEFORE execution
- AppHash is unknown at proposal time
- Validators execute and vote with AppHash separately
- Allows pipelined execution

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented

---

### Q2: Should AppHash be in Vote/Certificate?
**Answer: YES** ‚úÖ

**Decided:** Votes and Certificates MUST include AppHash

**Reason:**
- Cryptographically bind state to consensus
- Detect Byzantine validators with divergent state
- Enable light client state verification
- Match HotStuff/Tendermint/Hyperliquid architecture

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (2025-10-11)

---

### Q3: Should we have separate PayloadHash?
**Answer: ADD SOON** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Decided:** Add PayloadHash field, use hash instead of raw bytes in BlockHash

**Reason:**
- Compact headers for efficient header-first sync
- Light client support (verify headers without full payload)
- Foundation for Merkle proofs
- Standard in all production chains

**Status:** üîú Recommended to add now

---

### Q4: Do we need Parent hash in Block?
**Answer: YES** ‚úÖ

**Decided:** Block.Parent = Hash of parent block (consensus hash)

**Reason:**
- Links blocks into chain structure
- Detects forks and reorgs
- Standard in all blockchains
- Already implemented correctly

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (already there)

---

### Q5: Do we need parent's StateRoot (like Ethereum)?
**Answer: NO** ‚ùå

**Decided:** Don't include parent's AppHash in Block header

**Reason:**
- Ethereum does this for PoW mining (know state before proposing)
- We use BFT with fast finality (no need)
- Would require optimistic execution (complex)
- Tendermint/HotStuff don't do this either

**Status:** ‚úÖ Not needed

---

## Part 2: Current Architecture

### Block Structure
```go
type Block struct {
    Height   Height      // Block number
    View     View        // Consensus round
    Parent   Hash        // Parent's BlockHash (consensus hash)
    AppHash  Hash        // Application state hash (after execution)
    Payload  []byte      // Raw transaction bytes
    Proposer NodeID      // Who proposed this block
    Time     time.Time   // Block timestamp
}
```

### Three Hashes We Have

#### 1. BlockHash (Consensus Hash)
```go
BlockHash = SHA256(
    Height       // 8 bytes
    View         // 8 bytes
    Parent       // 32 bytes - parent's BlockHash
    Payload      // Variable - raw transaction bytes
    Proposer     // Variable - validator ID
    Time         // 8 bytes - timestamp
)
```

**Used for:**
- Voting (validators vote on BlockHash)
- Certificates (QC commits to BlockHash)
- Chain structure (Parent field points to BlockHash)

**Does NOT include:**
- ‚ùå AppHash (state commitment is separate)
- ‚ùå PayloadHash (raw bytes included directly)

#### 2. AppHash (Application State Hash)
```go
AppHash = SHA256(
    Height       // 8 bytes - ensures uniqueness per block
    Timestamp    // 8 bytes - additional entropy
    OrderbookState // Deterministic hash of all orderbook levels
)
```

**Used for:**
- Voting (validators vote on AppHash)
- Certificates (proves 2f+1 validators agree on state)
- State verification (light clients, fraud proofs)

**Will extend to include:**
- [ ] Account balances
- [ ] Open positions
- [ ] Funding rates
- [ ] Oracle prices
- [ ] Validator stakes
- [ ] Bridge state

#### 3. Parent Hash (Chain Link)
```
Block.Parent = BlockHash of previous block
```

**Used for:**
- Chain structure (links blocks)
- 2-chain commit rule (parent-child relationship)
- Fork detection

**Points to:**
- Parent's CONSENSUS hash (BlockHash)
- NOT parent's state hash (AppHash)

---

## Part 3: What We DON'T Have (and why)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PayloadHash (Transaction Root) - Should Add

**What it would be:**
```go
PayloadHash = Hash(Payload)  // Or MerkleRoot(transactions)
```

**Why we should add it:**
- Standard in all production chains
- Enables light clients
- Compact headers for efficient sync
- Foundation for Merkle proofs

**When to add:** Now or very soon

---

### ‚ùå Parent's AppHash in Block

**What Ethereum does:**
```go
Block N header includes:
  - parentHash (Block N-1's consensus hash)
  - stateRoot (State AFTER Block N-1 execution) ‚Üê Ethereum includes this
```

**Why we don't do this:**
- Ethereum needs this for PoW (miners know state before mining)
- BFT doesn't need it (validators execute after voting)
- Adds complexity (optimistic execution)
- Tendermint/HotStuff don't do this

---

### ‚ùå ReceiptsRoot (Execution Results)

**What Ethereum has:**
```go
ReceiptsRoot = MerkleRoot(all transaction receipts)
```

**Why we don't have it:**
- No EVM (no complex receipts)
- Order execution results are simple (fills)
- Can add later if needed for EVM surface

## Part 4: Comparison with Other Chains

| Hash Type | HyperLicked | Ethereum | Tendermint | Flow | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|------|---------|
| **BlockHash** | ‚úÖ Yes (incl. raw Payload) | ‚úÖ Yes (Header only) | ‚úÖ Yes (Header only) | ‚úÖ Yes (Header only) | Chain structure |
| **AppHash** | ‚úÖ Yes (in Vote/Cert) | ‚úÖ Yes (stateRoot) | ‚úÖ Yes (separate) | ‚úÖ Yes (StateCommit) | State commitment |
| **PayloadHash** | ‚ùå No (raw bytes in hash) | ‚úÖ Yes (txRoot) | ‚úÖ Yes (DataHash) | ‚úÖ Yes (PayloadHash) | Tx commitment |
| **ReceiptsRoot** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | Execution results |
| **Parent Hash** | ‚úÖ Yes (consensus hash) | ‚úÖ Yes (prev blockHash) | ‚úÖ Yes (LastBlockID) | ‚úÖ Yes (ParentID) | Chain link |
| **Parent State** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (prev stateRoot) | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | Mining optimization |

### Key Insight
Our architecture matches **Tendermint/Flow** (BFT) more than **Ethereum** (PoW/PoS).

## Part 5: Evolution Path & Recommendations

### Current Implementation ‚úÖ DONE

**What we have:**
```
Block:
  - Parent: Hash (consensus hash of parent)
  - AppHash: Hash (state after execution) ‚úÖ
  - Payload: []byte (raw transactions)

BlockHash = Hash(height, view, parent, payload, proposer, time)
Vote includes: (BlockHash, AppHash) ‚úÖ
Certificate includes: (BlockHash, AppHash) ‚úÖ
```

**Status:** AppHash verification working, Byzantine detection ready

---

### Next Step: Add PayloadHash ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED NOW

**Add PayloadHash:**
```go
type Block struct {
    Height      Height
    View        View
    Parent      Hash
    PayloadHash Hash      // ‚Üê NEW: Hash(Payload)
    AppHash     Hash
    Payload     []byte
    Proposer    NodeID
    Time        time.Time
}

BlockHash = Hash(height, view, parent, payloadHash, proposer, time)
                                       ‚Üë 32 bytes instead of raw MB
```

**Benefits:**
- Fixed-size headers (~200 bytes)

```

**Benefits:**
- Merkle inclusion/exclusion proofs
- Light clients can verify "tx X in block Y"
- State proofs for specific accounts
- Fraud proofs for rollups/bridges

**Libraries:**

- Simple Merkle tree implementation

**Effort:** ~1000 lines, 1-2 weeks
**When needed:** Light clients requiring state proofs, cross-chain bridges

---

### Optional Advanced Features üîÆ AS NEEDED

**Consider adding:**

1. **ReceiptsRoot** (if EVM added)
   - Merkle root of execution results
   - Proves "tx X succeeded with result Y"

2. **Parent state** (if needed for bridges)
   - Include parent's AppHash in block
   - Enables atomic cross-chain proofs

3. **Validator signatures** (for light clients)
   - Include validator set and signatures
   - Light clients verify without full node

## Conclusion

**Current architecture is SOLID:**
- ‚úÖ Matches Tendermint/HotStuff model
- ‚úÖ AppHash verification working
- ‚úÖ Byzantine detection working
- ‚úÖ Production-ready consensus

**Recommended next step:**
1. **Add PayloadHash** (2-3 hours) - Industry standard, enables light clients
2. **Merkle trees** (optional) - Only when you need advanced cryptographic proofs
3. **Other features** - As needed for your specific use cases

**You're building it right!** üéâ

The foundation is solid. PayloadHash is the natural next evolution for a production blockchain.
